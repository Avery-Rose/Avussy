# This MD file is to store some ideas I might have for the future of this website

[Video Guide](https://youtu.be/7CqJlxBYj-M?t=4956)

## Ideas

- MongoDB

  - [x] Project Data should be stored in the database.[^1]

- Frontend
  - [ ] Create a admin panel for the website.[^2]
  - [ ] There should be placeholder content for projects and other elements of the website.[^3]

[^1]:
    This will allow for the frontend to dynamically projects I chose to share.
    data could include: title, description, image, link, etc.

[^2]: The admin panel will allow me to add projects to the database.
[^3]: If there is missing content, I can add filler content. let's say a missing image then it should display a placeholder image.
